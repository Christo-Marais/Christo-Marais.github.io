Christo Marais - Virtual CV - Portfolio

Overview:
This virtual CV website is a personal portfolio showcasing my education, skills, projects, and professional links. It has been designed with modern web technologies to ensure a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate, and responsive user experience.

Hosting:
The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, utilizing GitHub's free web hosting service to deploy the site directly from a repository. This method allows for easy version control and quick updates through Git, making the deployment process seamless and efficient.

Innovation:
The site is designed with a unique and user-friendly interface that aligns with modern web design trends. The use of a grid layout ensures that content is organized clearly and intuitively. Additionally, features like a downloadable CV button and direct links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles are integrated to enhance the website's functionality.

Web Technologies:
The website is built using HTML5 and CSS3, ensuring compatibility with current web standards. CSS flexbox is used for layout management, making the site responsive across different devices.

Compatibility:
The website is tested to ensure it displays correctly across major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is also designed to be fully responsive, ensuring that it functions well on desktops. As for mobile devices the website does not do such a good job.

Navigation:
The website features a simple, intuitive navigation menu at the top of the page. Each section (About Me, Education, Projects, My Links) is easily accessible through this menu. The layout ensures that users can find and access content quickly. The navigation buttons are larger for easy interaction, and each section is clearly labelled.
